# DIY Community Meetups

Welcome to Do It Yourself Community Meetups. A place where you can find all the resources you need to host your very own meetup.

**Project Snapshot:**

- Bring together your local community
- Get funding in Dai
- Create learning opportunities around MakerDAO & Dai

## What are we trying to accomplish?

Maker is only as strong as its community. By hosting a meetup in your area, you can help develop a local community that is passionate about Dai and the ecosystem that is being built around it. Through the meetups project, we seek to:

1. Give the Maker community the resources they need to organize successful meetups.
1. Develop a grassroots movement that educates, inspires, and grows the Maker ecosystem and community.
1. Encourage local Maker communities to collaborate on projects on top of the Maker Protocol & Dai.

## Project Description

This program is a major initiative of the Maker Foundation. We offer a [micro-granting](community/meetups/meetups-en/requesting-funds.md) program to help fund local community meetups.

Additionally, we're working with the community to actively develop a collection of guides to help you, even if you've never planned an event before. Currently, these include a [Getting Started Guide](community/meetups/meetups-en/getting-started-guide.md), [Budget Guide](community/meetups/meetups-en/Budget-Guide.md), [Promotion Guide](community/meetups/meetups-en/Promotion-Guide.md), and an [Event Formats Guide](community/meetups/meetups-en/Event-Formats-Guide.md).

## Is this for me?

**Hosting Meetups**
Do you enjoy hosting events and bringing people together? We're eager to support people who want to build the Maker community together in their city.

- Passionate about MakerDAO and Dai.
- Access to a community of people.
- Ability to organize and host an event.

**Contribute to the Hosting Guides**
Not in a position to host? No problem. We're constantly looking to improve the quality of our Hosting Guides.

- Prior hosting experience a plus, but not necessary.
- Experience writing or editing.

## How do I get involved?

Ready to start planning your meetup? We've created a [guide](community/meetups/meetups-en/getting-started-guide.md) to help you get started.

## Status

Micro-grant [applications](https://airtable.com/shr415iT3e8S8nuzS) are open.

As of June, 2019 we have funded 20? meetups across 10 different countries. (will refine shortly)

## Important Disclaimer

These meetups are **not for speculating on the price of the token or general hype.** The main goal of hosting meetups is to bring people together and educate them about MakerDAO and Decentralized Finance. When talking about the MKR token the goal should be to educate the attendees about the purpose and utility of the token. Presentations can focus on the MakerDAO ecosystem, how MakerDAO and Dai interact with open finance, decentralized governance, or other relevant topics.
